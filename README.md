# Snake

In this basic program you can move in 4 directions on a 10 by 10 grid. You need to write which direction do you wanna move in (with the a, w, s and d keys) and then press enter to execute the movement. The program spawns "apples" represented by '+' characters, your score will go up by one for every one you collect.

The name of the repository is misleading, there are two functionalities missing from this program for it to be a real snake game. First one is that it dosent parse the inputs in real time (onl yafter the Enter key was pressed). The second is that the "snake" does not grow, its lengt will forever remain 1.
